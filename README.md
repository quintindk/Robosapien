# Robosapien

This is the IR interfacing code that was branched from Carl Monk (@ForToffee). Thanks to him for the original code.

## Introduction

Essentially this is a web server that interfaces directly with a Robosapien v1 using the IR codes. The web server uses flask to present a POST method for a consumer to interact with.

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
python server.py
```

## Contributions

Thank you, I appreciate you.
